# Push_swap

## Project Description
Push_swap is an algorithmic project that sorts integers using two stacks (a and b) with a limited set of operations. The challenge is to find the most efficient sequence of moves to sort the stack in ascending order while minimizing operations.

## Key Features
- **Optimized sorting** for random integer sequences
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs (non-integers, duplicates, overflows)
- **Multiple operations** including push, swap, and rotate commands
- **Performance benchmarks** for different stack sizes

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
```

## Usage

### Basic execution
```bash
  ./push_swap [integer_sequence]
```
### Example
```bash
./push_swap 3 1 4 2 5
```
